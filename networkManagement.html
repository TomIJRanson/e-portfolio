									<p>
									  This module introduces students to the underpinning concepts of Computer Networks and the skills of Information Security Management. This includes an introduction to network security fundamentals and information security governance principles. It will be based on mapping information security management roles onto a number of security models. The module describes the security management and protection issues involving business resources, risks, monitoring as well as business continuity strategies. It will also discuss common diagnostic and monitoring tools utilised as part of a Network and Information Security practice such as nessus, snort, syslog and ELK. Students will be introduced to the techniques in an engaging format, using a mixture of group work and individual activities. 
									</p>

									<h2>Collaborative Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>Upon reading Read Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth). Answer the following discussion questions:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>What are the major threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the paper?
								</li>
							<li>How would you mitigate against these?
								</li></ul>
							<h3>Initial Post
							</h3>
							<p>
								From evaluating the article "Compromising a medical mannequin" (Glisson, et al., 2015) it’s clear that the pace at which technology is moving forward in the medical industry is faster than the cyber security considerations are being evaluated. The particularly important observation that a breach of a training tool would result in a clinician receiving the incorrect guidance when problem solving is insightful. The discrepancy in technology to security considerations in this industry can potentially result in loss of life so should be treated with an urgency befitting that status.</p>
							<p>
								Two types of attack highlighted in this paper were Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Brute Force attacks. It’s important to mention at this stage that both types of attack are easy to perform with readily available software so, as such, should be taken very seriously.</p>
							<p>
								Focusing initially on Brute Force attacks, the basic protection against it is easily implemented but by no means an exhaustive style of protection. According to the paper "Password Strength: An Empirical Analysis” (Dell’Amico, et al., 2010) the findings showed ability to brute force a password is reduced as the possible data set the password can be taken from is increased. This leads to the obvious implementation of a ‘minimal specification’ for a password securing an access point. A dictionary word being the lowest form of security up to a random string of characters being the highest. Increasing the number of characters increases the security by a significant factor with each character added. Despite this evidence it is well documented (Farik & Ali, 2015) that access point manufactures don’t employ this sort of security regularly. Designing the system with a simple “three strikes” rule for guessing access codes would halt brute force attempts quite quickly. When the code is guessed incorrectly a certain number of times the system should lock and not allow any more access attempts to be made. It has the added benefit of alerting a legitimate user of a current malicious access attempt because their access session would be locked out too.</p>
							<p>
								DoS attacks are a popular and complex problem in current cyber security due to the ever-expanding complexity of attacks and intelligence of the server requests. Two papers (Prakash, et al., 2016), (Kumar & Amin, 2021) detail ways that current technologies can be leveraged to qualify the type and purpose of connections to a server to catch malicious connections. Requests not meeting the requirements for a legitimate connection are discarded keeping server load to a minimum. The battle with this sort of attack is the increasing complexity with which these requests are made. As quickly as a new exploit is patched, malicious hackers find new ways around the systems. The current trend of utilising blockchain technologies allows for security solutions to evolve automatically, to a degree, which will help to keep up with the attackers, but is by no means a silver bullet.</p>
							<p>
								However, utilising experience from a background in chemical laboratory management, applying the principle of parsimony “entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity” or, to paraphrase, the simplest explanation is usually the best one. The first solution that should be applied to this specific situation is to analyse if a wireless connection from the medical mannequin is even required in the first instance. A physical connection between mannequin and controlling devices would eliminate a remote attack. A physical cage for storage of controlling machines would eliminate malicious control of the software. While comparatively “low tech” these solutions should be the first consideration when deploying these devices. Firstly, ask yourself “Do we have to use this specific setup” before exploring ways to mitigate issues with a system we might not have to use.</p>
